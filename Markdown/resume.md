Personal Profile

I am a hardworking and dedicated person who, when I start to work on a
subject that interests me will tend to not put it down until the job is
done. I come from a family that is half Quebecois and half American so
am perfectly fluent in both French and English. I have spent the last 6
years working aboard a tall ship and spending my winters outside of
university leading the work to fix the ships and summers sailing her as
the on deck officer and more recently as the head engineer around the
Eastern Canada having gone as far east as Newfoundland and New York City
and west as Georgian Bay. I am thus very accustomed to high pressure
work environments, problem solving and leading as well as love
designing, building and implementing solutions to these problems.

In the last year I have also been working with the Physics Society as
year representative and have taken a special interest in high energy
physics as demonstrated by my choices of labs in the lab course last
year as well as this upcoming year, as detailed below. I have also been
very interested in furthering my computer skills in relation simulating
problems as way of solving them and computational physics analysis.
