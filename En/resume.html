        <h4>Personal Profile</h4>

        <p>I am a hardworking and dedicated person who, when I start to work on a
        subject that interests me will tend to not put it down until the job is
        done. I come from a family that is half Quebecois and half American so
        am perfectly fluent in both French and English. I have spent the last 6
        years working aboard a tall ship and spending my winters outside of
        university leading the work to fix the ships and summers sailing her as
        the on deck officer and more recently as the head engineer around the
        Eastern Canada having gone as far east as Newfoundland and New York City
        and west as Georgian Bay. I am thus very accustomed to high pressure
        work environments, problem solving and leading as well as love
        designing, building and implementing solutions to these problems.</p>

        <p>In the last year I have also been working with the Physics Society as
        year representative and have taken a special interest in high energy
        physics as demonstrated by my choices of labs in the lab course last
        year as well as this upcoming year, as detailed below. I have also been
        very interested in furthering my computer skills in relation simulating
        problems as way of solving them and computational physics analysis.</p>
